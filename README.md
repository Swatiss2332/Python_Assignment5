## Task 1: Student Marks Lookup
# Objective:
Create a program that stores student names and their marks using a dictionary. The program allows a user to input a student’s name and retrieves the corresponding marks.

# Key Features:

Uses a dictionary with student names as keys and marks as values.

Prompts the user to enter a name.

Displays the student’s marks if found.

Displays a "Student not found" message if the name doesn't exist in the dictionary.

# Example Output:
Enter the student's name: Alice  
Alice's marks: 85

Enter the student's name: John  
Student not found.



## Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing
# Objective:
Demonstrate list slicing by manipulating a list of numbers.

# Key Features:

Creates a list containing numbers from 1 to 10.

Extracts the first five elements using slicing.

Reverses these extracted elements.

Prints the original list, sliced list, and reversed result.

Example Output:
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]  
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Reversed extracted elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]


## How to Run the Programs
